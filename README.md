...and here we go. We haven't even heard which of the two candidates are going
to be taking over the position of Tory-in-chief, and we are already getting
ministeriial resignations. As we go into the latest installation of the period
of chaos (POC = July 24th 2016 -> Present) I am hoping to keep this blog partly
as a diary to keep track of my personal thinking, and also as a resource for
me to try to inject some facts into future thought process, and analysis of
the various goings-on.
